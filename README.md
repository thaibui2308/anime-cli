# Anime CLI ðŸŒ¸

Basically https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli/blob/master/ani-cli but rewritten in Go

Instead of playing the selected episodes using mpv, I just play them straight in the browser 


# Quick Start ðŸš€
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thaibui2308/anime-cli.git
cd anime-cli
go get -d ./...
go run main.go
go install
```

# Basic Command ðŸ–¼
anime-cli find <ANIME_NAME>
